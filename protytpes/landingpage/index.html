            <h1>Wack-a-what?!</h2>
            <p>Wack-a-doo is a MMO strategy game in which you take care of a
              tribe of wacky cavemen. Help them prosper and grow and lead them
              into battle or make friends with other tribes. You will be able
              to enter their persistent world anytime and anywhere, using a
              browser, an iPhone or iPad. </p>
          </div><div class="panel-column" id="column-r1c2">
            <h1>So, what's different?</h2>
            <p>Unlike other MMO strategy games, our units are actually visible
              on the world map, and don't just teleport around invisibly. More
              like a board game, really. Whack-a-doo is being developed as a
              true cross-platform game from the start. There will be no lousy
              platform-inappropriate interfaces! We have dinosaurs. Can't beat
              dinosaurs.</p>

            <h1>How much does it cost?</h2>
            <p>You can play for the great price of free. However, we, too, have
              to feed our dinosaurs somehow. That's why you'll also have the
              opportunity to give us small amounts of money and benefit from
              convenience features, time-savers and small boosts. We are
              however firm believers that multiplayer games should always be
              balanced and should never turn into auctions.</p>

            <h3>Armies on the world map</h3>
            <p>Armies are always visible on the world map. No more giving orders
              through interfaces that look like spreadsheets! They actually
              exist on the world map, too, so they can't just teleport through
              enemy territory like they do in other games in this genre. This
              adds a new strategic gameplay dimension, because for the first
              time, location affects more than just travel time. So it's more
              like board games and RTS games.</p>

            <h3>True cross-platform</h3>
            <p>Whack-a-doo is being developed as a true cross-platform game
              from the very beginning. We take extra care that each platform's
              interface is specifically tailored to its individual properties.
              While you play in the browser, it will feel like a browser game
              and when you're playing on your iPad, it will feel like a true
              iPad game.</p>

            <p>The current release of Whack-a-doo it as a html5 browser game
              (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari). A native iOS
              Client is next.</p>

            <h3>Who are you guys, anyway?</h3>
            <p>Weâ€˜re avid fans of the genre and some of us were heavily
              involved in one of its first games, Uga-Agga, which even today,
              after many, many years, still has a loyal, active fanbase. Now
              we want to take it one step further and already have a bunch of
              revolutionary innovations planned that we will announce soon.
              Stay put!</p>
